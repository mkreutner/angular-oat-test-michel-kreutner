# AngularOatTestMichelKreutner

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.
This project aims to propose a solution for OAT front exercise:
```
_Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)_. Create a component that enables you to load the data from the service created during step 1 and display the names of the test takers.
> Nice to have: The component should be reused to display other kind of data.
```

I choose to use Angular because I like this framework and it's quick to realize a SPA whith it.

Run `yarn install` or `npm install` in order to install required packages.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
